# Final Project

This repository includes contents for the final project for __DATA550.__

## Introduction

The data set contains stats from the players of the Atlanta Braves baseball 
team ranging from 1966 to 2023. This includes their age, position played, number
of ball hits, home runs, and dominant hand. For this project, we are interested
in years 1995 and 2021 which are the years the Braves won the World Series. In 
particular, this repository aims to compare the batting stats between the two years.

Variables of focus include batting average, stolen bases, home runs, number of 
games played, and dominant hand.

## Code Structure

The directories in the repository are output, data, and code.

The data folder contains the raw data. The code folder includes R scripts

data_clean.R selects years 1995 and 2021, selects our wanted variables, and removes pitchers since pitchers do not typically bat

updated_descriptive_table.R contains the code to make a table compare batting
stats for 1995 and 2021

graph.R contains code to create a box block. 

render.R will be used to render the final html report.


# How to generate the report
