# Final Project

This repository includes contents for the final project for __DATA550.__

## Introduction

The data set contains stats from the players of the Atlanta Braves baseball 
team ranging from 1966 to 2023. This includes their age, position played, number
of ball hits, home runs, and dominant hand. For this project, we are interested
in years 1995 and 2021 which are the years the Braves won the World Series. In 
particular, this repository aims to compare the batting stats between the two years.
Variables of focus include batting average, stolen bases, home runs, number of 
games played, and dominant hand.

## Code Structure
